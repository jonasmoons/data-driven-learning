# Lovetest exercise
## Basic
Write a program that asks for two names, then lowercases and strips those names and compares them. Have different outcomes when the names are equal (==), greater (>) or lesser (<).

## Advanced
Calculate a 'similarity percentage' based on multiple criteria, such as:
* Length of names
* Similarity of characters in the names
* If the combination is popular
* Whatever you can think of yourself
