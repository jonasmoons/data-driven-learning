# Fundamentals of Machine Learning (University of Applied Sciences Utrecht)

## What is on Canvas and what is on GitHub?
* On GitHub: example Notebooks, slides, extra material, exercises (in slides), data sets
* On Canvas: student manual, assignments, overview of content per week

## Examples and exercises
Example code can be found in the Examples folder. During class, exercises will be shown on the slides. The data sets for these exercises can be found in the corresponding example folder. These are exercises you can make during the lesson to test your knowledge. You **don't** need to submit these; however, you may post a link to your Notebook on Slack. I will use this to get a general sense of how things are going. See the folder for the material.

* [Markdown cheatsheet (for text in Notebooks)](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) 

### Mathematics
Using tools from data science and machine learning would not make a lot of sense without some understanding of mathematics and statistics. However, the focus of the course is on the application of data science, rather than the mathematical foundation. If I use formulas, I will not focus on the technical aspects, but explain what they do conceptually. If you need to catch up on math, you can use these links to the [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/):

* [Basic algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/introduction-to-algebra)
* [Equations and variables](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/one-variable-linear-equations)
* [Squares and roots](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/in-eighth-grade-math/squares-square-roots)
* [The coordinate plane and linear equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/two-var-linear-equations)
* [Exponents](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/pre-algebra-exponents-radicals#pre-algebra-exponents) and [logarithms](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/exponential-and-logarithmic-functions/introduction-to-logarithms/a/intro-to-logarithms)
* [Basic probability theory](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/probability-geometry#probability-basics)

### Data science and machine learning
* Good introduction: [Machine learning is fun](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-80ea3ec3c471)

### Tips
* Google, [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/) are your friends. It’s not a shame to Google even really basic concepts.
* Your code should be properly commented (use `#`). Good commenting means you explain also why you do something, not just what you’re doing.
* Visualize and explore your data. Get acquainted with your data. Explore cases that deviate from the trend (outliers).
* Visualize your model predictions and [residuals](http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/why-you-need-to-check-your-residual-plots-for-regression-analysis) to look for ways to improve your model. 
* Properly label your graphs and axes.
